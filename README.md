## Contributing
Suggestions are welcome! Please feel free to open an issue if you have any ideas or feedback.

At the moment, we are **not accepting pull requests (PRs)**, as the first phase of the project is not yet complete.

## Shapes

PDFl supports basic shapes. You can draw rectangles inside a `<content>` block using the `<retacle />` element:

```pdfl
<retacle pos_x="100" pos_y="100" width="100" height="100" color="#FF0000" />
```

Attributes are optional and default to position `(50,50)`, size `50x50`, and the color black.
